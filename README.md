The rockPaperScissor program is a game for a user to play against a computer opponent. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices "Rock, Paper, or Scissor". The user's selection competes with that random choice and is judged using the following rubric: 
Paper defeats Rock; Scissor defeats Paper; Rock defeats Scissor. I learned the importance of positioning of return values, and the value of being mindful of scope within (and outside of) a function. Sorta makes or breaks the function.
